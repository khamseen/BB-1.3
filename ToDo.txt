//fn_selfActions.sqf
Revise some of the options so they are neater (Done)

//Flag change
Change flag to something less specific, since we're not all American (Done)

Stop people being able to build standard tank traps, sand bag walls, wire fences, or camo nets. (Done)

//ReadMe
Put together a readme for 1.8 (Done)

//Removal
Address problem with removing extendable objects. You can't remove things unless you can target them with the cursor. (Think this is ok, since we have castle stairs and scaffolding to use for height)

//----------------------- Still Need Looked At --------------------

//Keybinds
Look at different ways of implementing keybinds, hopefully we can find a way to do it without having to include every dayz version specific keybind from compiles. 

//Sarge AI
Setup a master variable to enable/disable all AI functionality and control options

//Build List
Finalise recipies and build items
Add replacements for old buildables: tank traps, sand bag walls, wire fences, and camo nets.

//ReadMe
Put together a readme for older versions
Put together a readme for Epoch

//Backwards Compatability
Create duplicate files and change public variables, build list requirements etc to pre 1.8

//------------------ Would Be Nice ------------------------

//Sarge AI
Test with new array system to make sure it still works as intended (Daimyo's Sarge install is very customized, can't make heads or tails of it)

//Lighting
Try to implement toggle tower lights with generator
