Things to Do

//-------------------------- DONE --------------------------
//enterCodeAdd.sqf
Change the Hint window to something more appealing (Done)

//enterCodeRemove.sqf
Change the Hint window to something more appealing (Done)

//add_UIDCode.sqf
Change the Hint window to something more appealing (Done)

//remove_UIDCode.sqf
Change the Hint window to something more appealing (Done)

//give_gateAccess.sqf
Change the Hint window to something more appealing (Done)

//Player_build2.sqf
May not need seperate sections for building placement section? (Done)
Loop the animation so people are aware they are still building. (Done)

//fn_selfActions.sqf
Revise some of the options so they are neater (Done)

//Flag change
Change flag to something less specific, since we're not all American (Done)

//Build List
Merge into file (Done)

//player_build.sqf
Stop people being able to build standard tank traps, sand bag walls, wire fences, or camo nets. (Done)

//ReadMe
Put together a readme for 1.8 (Done)

//Removal
Address problem with removing extendable objects. You can't remove things unless you can target them with the cursor. (Think this is ok, since we have castle stairs and scaffolding to use for height)

//Backwards Compatability
Create duplicate files and change public variables, build list requirements etc to pre 1.8 (Done, Generic Version)

//Sarge AI
Setup a master variable to enable/disable all AI functionality and control options (Done)

//ReadMe + Install Stuff
Put together a readme for older versions (Done)
Put together a readme for Epoch (Done)
Alter generic version readme to explain how to add keybinds from compiles.sqf (Done)
Provide 'new install' and 'update install' SQL scripts to avoid deployable IDs being changed (Done)
Combine the 'update install' DB additions with the 'update to 1.3' script so they still only have one script to run (Done)

//----------------------- Still Need Looked At --------------------

//Build List
Finalise recipes and build items
Add replacements for old buildables: tank traps, sand bag walls, wire fences, and camo nets.

//ReadMe + Install Stuff
Hive SQL scripts still need sorted

//------------------ Would Be Nice ------------------------

//Sarge AI
Test with new array system to make sure it still works as intended (Daimyo's Sarge install is very customized, can't make heads or tails of it)

//Lighting
Try to implement toggle tower lights with generator

//Keybinds
Look at different ways of implementing keybinds, hopefully we can find a way to do it without having to include every dayz version specific keybind from compiles. (Doesn't appear possible)
