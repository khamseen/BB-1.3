All of these edits are to be made in the dayz_mission.pbo (mission file name may vary)

****STEP 1 (Copying Files)****

First, unpack your mission file.
Now from the Base Building zip\dayz.mission\, copy over the following

buildRecipeBook 				(Folder)
dayz_code						(Folder)
REsec							(Folder)
build_recipe_dialog.hpp			(File)
build_recipe_dialog_list.hpp	(File)
defines.hpp						(File)

****STEP 2 (Modifying init.sqf)****
**A**
Find

progressLoadingScreen 0.1;

Directly ABOVE that, add (This is VERY important, if the placement of this line is wrong you will not be able to connect to the server)

call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "dayz_code\init\variables.sqf";							//Initializes custom variables

**B**
Find

progressLoadingScreen 1.0;
	
Directly ABOVE that, add
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "dayz_code\init\compiles.sqf";							//Compile custom compiles
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "dayz_code\init\settings.sqf";							//Initialize custom clientside settings

**C**
If you use RESec find (if you don't use it, you can delete the REsec folder and skip this step)

if (dayz_REsec == 1) then {
#include "\z\addons\dayz_code\system\REsec.sqf"
};

And change it to

if (dayz_REsec == 1) then {
#include "REsec\REsec.sqf"
};

Save and close

****STEP 3 (Modifying description.ext)****
At the very top of the file, add

//####----####---- Base Building Start ----####----####
#include "defines.hpp"
#include "build_recipe_dialog.hpp"
#include "build_recipe_list_dialog.hpp"
//####----####---- Base Building End ----####----####

Then, remove ALL of this

###REMOVE START###
class RscText
{
	type = 0;
	idc = -1;
	x = 0;
	y = 0;
	h = 0.037;
	w = 0.3;
	style = 0x100; 
	font = Zeppelin32;
	SizeEx = 0.03921;
	colorText[] = {1,1,1,1};
	colorBackground[] = {0, 0, 0, 0};
	linespacing = 1;
};
class RscPicture
{
	access=0;
	type=0;
	idc=-1;
	style=48;
	colorBackground[]={0,0,0,0};
	colorText[]={1,1,1,1};
	font="TahomaB";
	sizeEx=0;

	sizeEx = 0.03921;
	colorText[] = {0.543,0.5742,0.4102,1.0};
};
class RscProgress
{
	x = 0.344;
	y = 0.619;
	w = 0.313726;
	h = 0.0261438;
	texture = "\ca\ui\data\loadscreen_progressbar_ca.paa";
	colorFrame[] = {0,0,0,0};
	colorBar[] = {1,1,1,1};
};
class RscProgressNotFreeze
{
	idc = -1;
	type = 45;
	style = 0;
	x = 0.022059;
	y = 0.911772;
	w = 0.029412;
	h = 0.039216;
	texture = "#(argb,8,8,3)color(0,0,0,0)";
};
###REMOVE END####

Save and close

****STEP 4 (Modifying fn_selfActions.sqf)****
If you do NOT already have a custom fn_selfActions.sqf, you can skip this step.

If you DO already have a custom fn_selfActions.sqf, refer to the fn_selfActions ReadMe for instructions.

Then open dayz_mission\dayz_code\init\compiles.sqf
Find this and delete it
//Custom Self Actions File
fnc_usec_selfActions = compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "dayz_code\compile\fn_selfActions.sqf";

****STEP 5 (player_build2.sqf)****
If you would like base building to ignore combat checks and not place players into combat when they finish building, skip this step.

If you would prefer base building to place players into combat upon completion or cancelling a build, delete player_build2.sqf and rename player_build2 - Combat System to player_build2.sqf

****Now refer to 1.8 DayZ_Server ReadMe.txt****
